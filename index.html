            <p>Hello! I'm Bigaston, the creator of Rush. I'm very happy of this game, Rush! When I start it, is it for a One Hour Game Jam, and I have create a little prototype for this game in one hour. After that, I think this is a nice gameplay and it's a good idea to work to a better version of this game. And that why I have create Rush. Now, you have 40 levels, a level editor and better graphics! <br> <br>
